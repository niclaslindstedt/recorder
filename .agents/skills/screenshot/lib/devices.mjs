// The windows the app is looked at in. Each is a CSS viewport, which is what
// decides the layout (`src/app/shape.ts`): under 1024 px wide the phone shell
// with the bottom bar, a short landscape window the stand, 1024 and past it
// the desk with the tabs on the top bar and Settings as a side panel.
//
// `mobile` turns on touch and the mobile viewport meta handling; the pixel
// ratio is the run's `--scale` (1 by default — quick to take and quick to
// read; 2 for a closer look at a line or a glyph).
