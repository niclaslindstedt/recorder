// npm tree (a `playwright` or `playwright-core` installed with -g — the web
// sandbox has one, with its browsers under PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH). The
// first copy whose browser is actually on disk wins, because a playwright-core
// is only as useful as the exact Chromium build it was released against.
