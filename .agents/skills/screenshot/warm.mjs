// Do the slow parts of a first `shoot.mjs` run ahead of time, so the run that
// matters starts shooting at once:
//
//   1. a playwright-core, installed into the skill if none on the machine has
//      its Chromium (lib/playwright.mjs says where it looks);
//   2. that Chromium, fetched if it is missing;
//   3. the demo build, made if the sources moved since the last one;
//   4. one page of it, opened and ready — which is also the proof that the
//      three above work together.
//
// Run it once when a session starts (it is idempotent and quick when nothing
// is missing), then shoot.
